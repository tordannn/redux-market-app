## About the project

Shortly, the app was created to solidify the knowledge of using Redux in developing React apps. Here you can see a simple online store with the following functionality:
* Adding books to cart;
* Managing the amount of cart items (``+``, ``-``, ``delete``);
* Dynamic update of the total order sum.
